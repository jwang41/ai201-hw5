# Mixtape

A social music app where friends share songs, build collaborative playlists, and track listening stats.

This is the starter repo for **Project 5: Mixtape Bug Hunt**. The app has five open issues in its tracker. Your job is to find, fix, and document at least three of them.

## App Structure

```

├── app.py                      # Flask app factory and DB setup

```

The bugs live in the `services/` layer. The routes call services — if something is broken in an endpoint, trace it back to the service it calls.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows (Command Prompt)
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows (Git Bash)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Seed the database with test data:

```bash
python seed_data.py
```

Run the app:

```bash
FLASK_APP=app:create_app flask run
```

> **macOS note:** If the app starts but requests hang or return connection refused, try `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead of `http://localhost:5000`. On macOS, `localhost` sometimes resolves to an IPv6 address that Flask isn't listening on.

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## The Five Open Issues

| # | Title | Affected service |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | My listening streak keeps resetting | `streak_service.py` |
| 2 | Friends Listening Now shows people from yesterday | `feed_service.py` |
| 3 | The same song keeps showing up twice in search | `search_service.py` |
| 4 | I got notified when a friend added my song to a playlist but not when they rated it | `notification_service.py` |
| 5 | The last song in a playlist never shows up | `playlist_service.py` |

Full issue descriptions are in the **Project 5 brief**. Read them carefully before opening any service file.

## How to Read the Code

Start with `models.py` to understand the data model. Then trace a feature through from its route to its service. For example:

- A user rates a song → `POST /songs/<song_id>/rate` → `routes/songs.py` → `notification_service.rate_song()`
- A user views a playlist → `GET /playlists/<id>/songs` → `routes/playlists.py` → `playlist_service.get_playlist_songs()`

Understanding the full call chain is part of the exercise — don't skip to the service file directly.

---

## Navigation Strategy

For each bug, the exploration followed the same general pattern rather than jumping straight to the known-buggy file:

1. **Start at the entry point, not the service.** Find the route in `routes/` that matches the reported user action, and confirm what it delegates to before assuming which service is at fault.
2. **Let the symptom narrow the search.** Details in the bug report (which day it happens, which fields are affected, which sibling feature works correctly) usually rule out entire branches of a function before you have to read them.
3. **Check existing tests first.** `tests/` shows which behaviors are already covered and which edge cases (day boundaries, empty results, positional slicing) were never exercised — a gap there is often adjacent to the bug.
4. **Diff structurally similar code paths.** Where two functions are supposed to behave the same way (e.g. two actions that both trigger a notification), reading them side by side surfaces omissions faster than reading either one in isolation.
5. **Read conditions literally.** Off-by-one slices and extra boolean clauses tend to hide in lines that look correct at a skim and only reveal themselves when read term-by-term.

The full per-bug investigation trace — what was checked, ruled out, and what specific line confirmed the root cause — is documented in `submission.md` under **Root Cause Analysis**.

## Submission

Create a branch named `bugfix/mixtape` for your fixes. Each bug fix should be its own commit using conventional format:

```
fix: correct Sunday boundary condition in streak reset logic
```

See the project brief for full submission requirements.
